## Design

### How to play
- The game is played on a 10x10 board.
- Player and computer both get 6 ships each:
    - 2 destroyers (2 grid spaces per ship)
    - 2 subs (3 grid spaces per sub)
    - 1 carrier (4 grid spaces)
    - 1 battleship (5 grid spaces)
- Each board will have the 6 ships randomly placed on 
  them.
- The ships will be concealed from each other.
- Take in turns to choose X and Y coordinates to target 
  the oponents ships.
- You have unlimited amount of shots.
- When all the computers ships are sunk you win unless the computer sinks yours first then  you lose.

### Design Choices
- Battleships is a strategy based guessing game written in python and played 
  in a terminal window.
- As this game is played in a terminal window I have opted to keep things simple.
- The battleship logo prints to the screen using a fast typing effect that spells out 
  battleships.
- The background is black and text white by default which I have left as the white stands 
  out and makes the text easy to read.

### Structure
- The structure of the game was designed to take turns between the player and computer.
- On arrival to the game the logo is printed and the user is asked if they are a returning 
  user and to enter Y or N.
- If N is entered then user is promted to sign up or if 
  Y is entered user is promted to log in to play.
- After log in/sign up is successful the game will start and ask the user if they have 
  played before, Y or N.
- If N is entered then instructions are shown or if Y 
  is entered the boards are printed to 
  the screen and the game begins.
- The user and computer now take turns guessing X and Y axis to target each others ships 
  and ultimatley sink them.
- The game finishes when user or computer has no ships 
  left.
- A win or lose message is printed to the screen and 
  asks if user wants to play again.
- If user wants to play again new boards are printed 
  with new ship positions
- If the user enters N the game ends and user is 
  displayed a goodbye message.
